</section>

<section class="Paragraph1">
<p> Stoicism is an ancient Greek school of philosophy founded at Athens by Zeno of Citium. The school taught that virtue, the highest good, is based on knowledge; the wise live in harmony with the divine Reason (also identified with Fate and Providence) that governs nature, and are indifferent to the vicissitudes of fortune and to pleasure and pain.</p>
</section>

<section class="Paragraph2">
Stoicism has been a common thread though some of history’s great leaders. It has been practiced by Kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs. Marcus Aurelius. Frederick the Great, Montaigne, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Theodore Roosevelt, General James Mattis, —just to name a few—were all influenced by Stoic philosophy.

<section class="Paragraph3">
Marcus Aurelius journaled to himself  almost everyday. This is why Stoicism matters today: it is a practical philosophy for everyday life, providing us with a compass for how to navigate good and bad fortune and with practical exercises to stay on course.
